A short explanation of why your time measurement method is accurate. this includes figuring out how and when to start and to stop the measurements:

I have used MPI_Wtime that returns the elapsed time. start timer, MPI_Wtime has been used after MPI_INIT that initialises the MPI execution environment and end timer, 
MPI_Wtime is used before MPI_Finalize that terminates the MPI Execution environment and the difference of these two values (endtime-starttime) gives the total time
taken by the process.
In the MPI code there are many parallel processes running and MPI_INIT() and MPI_Finalize() does not define beginning and ending of the parallel execution but it 
defines where the beginning and ending of MPI calls are allowed. Since the processes run in parallel from beginning to ending, when we use MPI_Wtime, it calculates 
each process timing. Since all the processes run in parallel we need to consider the maximum time taken by the processes, so I have considered MPI_Reduce which calculates the maximum time taken among all the processes. MPI_Reduce reduces multiple processes value to a single value i.e., in this case maximum value which is defined in MPI_Reduce as MPI_MAX in operations field. Since this program considers the maximum time taken by the parallel running processes, the time measurement is accurate.
