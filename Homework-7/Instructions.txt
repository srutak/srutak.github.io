Instructions to run the program:

1. Download and extract the files to public_html folder. Copy these files to rocks.cs.odu.edu.
2. Type make to create the executables. 
mpi-ring: point-to-point message passing ring algorithm.
mpi-star: point-to-point message passing star algorithm.
mpi-coll: The collective broadcast operation provided by the MPI.
3.  To run the program type mpirun -np 2 mpi-ring 1 i.e., mpirun -np (number of processes) (name of the executable) (size of message)
4. once the program is run it displays the total time taken by the MPI program.

The Excel sheet named message passing contains all the data of ring, star and collective broadcast named in the three different worksheets.
